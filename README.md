# Environment setup

Python 3 is required to run the tests. Use venv to create a virtual environment in this folder:

```python -m venv env```

To activate the environment:

```source env/bin/activate```

# Install dependencies

Once the environment is active, install the library dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Running tests

To execute all tests simply run:

```pytest```
